## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a decentralized NFT ticketing solution that allows event organizers to issue, manage, and validate tickets on the blockchain. NFT ticketing ensures transparency, prevents fraud, and enables unique experiences for ticket holders.

## Features

- Implementation of smart contracts for NFT ticketing
- Multi-chain deployment (Movement & Aptos)
- User interface for managing ticket sales and transfers
- Admin panel for creating and managing events
- QR code-based ticket validation
- Immutable ownership records on the blockchain

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- [Movement CLI](https://docs.movementlabs.xyz/) (for Movement deployments)
- [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli) (for Aptos deployments)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Deployment Options

### Movement Blockchain Deployment

To deploy your NFT ticketing contracts to the Movement blockchain:

```bash
yarn deploy:movement
```

This command will compile your NFT ticketing smart contracts and deploy them to the Movement blockchain network.

### Aptos Blockchain Deployment

To deploy your NFT ticketing contracts to the Aptos blockchain:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

## Running the dApp

After deploying your NFT ticketing contracts, you can start the decentralized application:

```bash
yarn start
```

or if you prefer npm:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start and be available in your browser.

## Learning Outcomes
